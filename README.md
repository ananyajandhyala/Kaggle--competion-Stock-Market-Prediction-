***Problem Statement***

Stock market prediction is the act of forecasting the future value of an individual stock, a particular sector, or the market as a whole.
This is an extremely lucrative service for companies to invest in, for understanding the trend of the stock prices of their company can yield great profits. 
However, this is not an easy feat, since the stock market is highly dependent on various global factors and as a result, can be highly erratic and volatile. 
Investment banks are institutions that act in an advisory role to help companies, individuals or governments make financial transactions.
Major shareholders in the automobile conglomerate Pearson-Spector Inc. (PSI US) have contacted the investment bank you work at to analyze the performance of the company in the stock market and make future stock price predictions.
The company has supplied past stock price data (performance from Jan 1, 2016, to July 31, 2022) to assist you in this goal. Using the data of the company's stock prices so far, your team has decided to predict the closing price of Pearson-Spector's stocks for an interval of time in the future (Aug 1, 2022, to Sep 20, 2022). Your team has been instructed to use ONLY this information and disregard any other factors while making predictions.
In addition to this, the bank also wants to know what models are best suited for stock price predictions, given similar data.
Note: Pearson-Spector Inc. is a fictitious company, so any information apart from what is given in the description above is irrelevant to the problem statement at hand.
